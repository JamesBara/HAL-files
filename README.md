This is a work in progress.

Custom HAL for stm32l452ret6.

Requirements:
To use this custom HAL the template files stm32l4xx.h, stm32l452xx.h, system_stm32l4xx.h are required.
The above files can be found in the CMSIS folder of stm32l4cube or downloaded from arm. Specifically they can be found in
the directory CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32L4xx/Include.
Also the file system_stm32l4xx.c is required. It can be found in the folder CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32L4xx/Source/Templates.
The user could make and use their own custom files.
